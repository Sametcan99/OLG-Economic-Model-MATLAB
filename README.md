# OLG-Economic-Model-MATLAB
"MATLAB simulation and analysis of the Overlapping Generations (OLG) economic model. This repository contains code for simulating long-term macroeconomic dynamics, including capital accumulation, savings, and consumption patterns, and assessing the impact of factors like technological progress on economic equilibrium."

üìù Project Overview
This project was undertaken as part of my Master's degree in Economic Data Analytics. It serves as a practical application of dynamic economic modeling and computational methods to understand complex intergenerational economic phenomena.

üéØ Objectives
To develop a functional OLG model simulation in MATLAB.

To analyze the convergence of key macroeconomic variables to their steady states.

To assess the impact of introducing technological progress on the model's dynamics (e.g., capital, savings, interest rates, and consumption).

To gain hands-on experience in translating theoretical economic models into numerical simulations.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
The project implements a two-period OLG model, building upon the foundational frameworks of Diamond (1965) and Samuelson (1958).
My approach involved:

Parameter Definition: Clearly setting up initial economic parameters (e.g., population growth rate, discount factor, capital share, initial capital stock).

Dynamic Simulation: Iterating the model's optimal solution equations to simulate the time paths of capital, output, wages, interest rates, savings, and consumption over multiple generations.

Steady-State Analysis: Numerically computing and graphically illustrating the steady-state equilibrium for capital, where the economy reaches a stable long-run position.

Scenario Analysis: Extending the model to incorporate an exogenous technological progress component and comparing its effects on capital accumulation, savings, and consumption against the baseline scenario.

Visualization: Plotting the dynamic convergence and comparative statics of all key variables to visually interpret the model's behavior.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
MATLAB: Primary programming environment for model implementation, simulation, and visualization.

üèÉ How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sametcan99/OLG-Economic-Model-MATLAB.git

(Remember to replace YourGitHubUsername with your actual GitHub username)

Open MATLAB: Launch the MATLAB application.

Navigate to the project directory: In MATLAB's Current Folder browser, navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository.

Run the main script: Open question1.m (or a renamed main script like run_olg_simulation.m if you create one for clarity) and execute it. The script will run the simulations and generate the relevant plots.

üìà Key Insights from Analysis
Demonstrates the convergence of key macroeconomic variables (capital, savings, consumption) towards a stable long-run steady state.

Illustrates how factors such as technological progress can influence the equilibrium levels and dynamic paths of these variables, typically leading to higher long-term capital accumulation and welfare.
